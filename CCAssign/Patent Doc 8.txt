A technique for combining transmission bandwidths of several communication devices, such as mobile stations is disclosed. A master mobile station establishes a WLAN access point communicating with WLAN client terminals. One or more slave mobile stations may detect a predefined network identifier and join the WLAN network. The master assigns IP addresses for the client terminals and slave mobile stations. The master also resolves DNS queries in cooperation with external DNS servers. Traffic, including internet packets, between the client terminals and various internet hosts is tunneled over multiple simultaneous transmission paths between the master and a multiplexing/demultiplexing computer). The inventive bandwidth combination technique is transparent to the client terminals and the internet hosts.
