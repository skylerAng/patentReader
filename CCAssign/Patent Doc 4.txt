A service processing method, a service processing system, and a PCRF entity are disclosed to overcome this defect in the prior art: The prior art is unable to handle services discriminatively according to the policy context information when different services require the same QoS level. The method includes: receiving bearer priority information from a PCRF entity, where the bearer priority information includes: bearer priority information of a service data stream, bearer priority information of an IP-CAN session, and/or bearer priority information of an IP-CAN bearer; and handling services according to the bearer priority information. In the embodiments of the present invention, the policy context information is converted into bearer priority information so that the PCEF handles services according to the bearer priority information. In this way, different services that require the same QoS level are handled discriminatively according to the policy context information.
