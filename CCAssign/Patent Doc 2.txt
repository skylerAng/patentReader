A method for multiplexing communication resources to multiple users in a communication system having no network resource planning. The method includes the steps of: generating a generic time-frequency (T-F) mapping pattern (TFPgeneric), generating a set of orthogonal T-F mapping patterns from said generic T-F mapping pattern (TFPgeneric), performing a random variable cyclic offsetting of said set of orthogonal T-F mapping patterns in each transmission time interval (TTI), and allocating the orthogonal T-F mapping patterns to the one or more users and/or traffic channels in each TTI. A transmitter for executing said multiplexing method, and a system including such transmitters, are also disclosed.
