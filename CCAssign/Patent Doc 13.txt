A method for supporting the traffics with different Quality of Service by a High Speed Downlink Packet Access System is provided by incorporating the features of the High Speed Downlink Packet Access System (HSDPA) and by means of the implementation for supporting the traffics with different Qos by the third generation of mobile communication system REL99 system. The method for supporting provides mapping and configuring of the parameters of Qos in the system. Queues for storing the data of different transport channels are added in a Media Access Control layer of a Base Station in the High Speed Downlink Packet Access System (HSDPA). A queue scheduling method is designed to ensure the requirements of the traffics with different Qos.
