A system and charging control method of network convergence policy and charging control architecture are disclosed, based on the QoS parameter, charging policy and user subscribing information granted by the service layer, the PCRF confirms PCC rule, and provides the PCC rule to the policy distribution function PDF. As the interface between the PCRF and PCC policy performing entity, the PDF performs the protocol conversion and information distribution. Based on the PCC rule, the PCC policy performing entity performs QoS policy of the service data flow and the detecting and charging of the service flow.
