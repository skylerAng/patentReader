Embodiments of the present invention disclose a method for routing control applied to a communication system including a CS domain and an IMS and in which a Routing Policy Decision-making Point (RPDP) is set; and the method includes: initiating a routing query to the RPDP by an interrogation network unit in the communication system upon receiving a service request; making a routing decision by the RPDP according to routing decision-making related information and the routing policy information, returning the routing decision to the interrogation networking unit by the RPDP; and performing subsequent routing control by the interrogation network unit according to the routing decision. Embodiments of the present invention also disclose a system for routing control. In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, across-domain routing control is thus realized in different network application environments according to different demands.
