A method, a system, and a device for network handoff is disclosed. A first evolved Access Network (eAN) sends a session transfer request to the target eAN that corresponds to the network handoff request. The first eAN receives a session transfer response from the target eAN. The first eAN sends a Traffic Channel Assignment (TCA) message to a User Equipment (UE) based on the session transfer response, so that the UE can switch from a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network to an evolved High Rate Packet Data (eHRPD) network based on the TCA message.
